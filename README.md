## Hey there! 👋

I'm Eduardo, a robotics engineering student at ITESM with a passion for building things that work in the real world.

### What I'm up to

Currently doing research at the Joint Robotics Laboratory (JRL) in Japan, working on tactile sensing systems for humanoid robots. When I'm not designing PCBs or writing embedded code, you'll find me exploring the intersection of hardware and AI and tinkering with autonomous vehicles at [VantTec](https://github.com/vanttec).

### Things I enjoy working on

- **Machine learning**: Especially when it runs on edge devices or when we can simulate reality for robot learning
- **Hardware meets software**: From PCB design to embedded programming, I love making electrons do useful things
- **Computer vision**: Teaching machines to see and understand their environment
- **Autonomous systems**: Self-driving cars, boats, and robots that can navigate the world

### Current focus

I'm deep into tactile sensing research, building custom hardware for robot teleoperation. Also working on flow-based models for trajectory generation and leading perception systems for autonomous vehicles.
